Hello-World
I am Joe DeMarco. I'm a proud father, a software tester, aspiring writer, and game designer. I have been learning mySQL, xcode, twine, and HTML. I hope to expand my skills to learn more about code, software testing, and writing. Quality assurance is where I am now, and have been for over 5 years. I hope to grow into a Quality Engineering position, or perhaps a game writer position. 

Looking forward to sharing what I learn.
