Hello-World
I am Joe DeMarco. I'm a proud father, a software tester, a writer, and game designer. 
I have been a manual software tester for over 9 years.
I am one of the lead writers for Elfwood, an upcoming seafaring campaign setting from Harsh Realities. 

I am trying to grow as a software developer and interactive fiction writer. Learning HTML/CSS/Javascript and expanding my skills in automation testing. I'm currently using online resources such as Udemy, Test Automation University, Test Rail, and more to expand my knowledge and experience. 

I've been told by several previous employers that I would do really well in project management. I'm very curious where that road leads. 

Looking forward to sharing what I learn.
